Assignment 1 : Review Paper on “Smart City : Technologies and challenges”
Summary of the Paper
The paper by Kincho H. Law and Jerome P. Lynch discusses the growing trend of smart cities, focusing on technological advancements in the U.S. It highlights how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can be integrated into urban environments to enhance areas such as transportation, environmental sustainability, healthcare, and education. 
The authors explore both the benefits and the challenges that accompany the adoption of smart city technologies, particularly concerning security, privacy, and inclusiveness. The paper also examines the impact of smart city initiatives on physical infrastructure and policy development, presenting a balanced overview of these innovations while acknowledging the challenges that must be addressed.

Identification of Gaps
A significant gap in the paper is its U.S.-centric perspective, limiting the discussion to challenges and solutions relevant to the U.S. context. The authors do not explore how smart city technologies might differ in their application and effectiveness in other regions with varying cultural, social, and economic conditions. Moreover, the paper overlooks the broader social implications of smart cities, such as the impact on societal hierarchies and community engagement. The authors focus primarily on technological aspects, missing opportunities to delve deeper into how these advancements affect citizens’ daily lives and societal structures.

Analysis of Ambiguities
The paper introduces some terms such as ""smart city"" and ""smart grid"" but never properly define what truly is this “smart city” and “smart grid” they are referring to. For instance, the concept of a smart city is defined largely in terms of its technological components without clarifying the end goal or broader vision beyond operational efficiency. Similarly, the term ""smart grid"" is discussed in technical terms without sufficiently explaining how it differs from traditional grids, especially for a non-technical audience. Furthermore, the paper’s presentation of ""spatiotemporal crime statistics"" is introduced without offering a clear definition of its mechanics, leaving readers unfamiliar with urban analytics confused about its real-world application.

Evaluation of Methodologies
The paper is based on a literature review and other papers, synthesizing existing research on smart city technologies. While this approach provides a broad overview of current advancements, it falls short in addressing the social and cultural implications of smart cities. The focus on technology, while comprehensive, tends to overshadow other important aspects such as the government, community engagement, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the comparative analysis between different technological advancements is limited, largely due to the lack of smart city development in diverse regions, which the authors acknowledge.
The methodologies in the paper lean more toward speculative discussions of the potential of smart cities rather than quantitative or qualitative analysis of specific implementations. A more rigorous evaluation of how well these technologies perform under different conditions would have strengthened the paper's argument.

Discussion of Questions Raised
There are several questions that should or could be raised from this paper. For instance, how do cities balance the trade-off between technological advancement and preserving privacy? How can policymakers develop frameworks to manage the rapid advancement in smart city technologies? The more important topic the paper also leaves open is the question of how to effectively measure the ""success"" of smart city initiatives. Should success be gauged primarily through economic gains and efficiency improvements, or should the focus be broader, including improvements in social equity, quality of life, and environmental sustainability?

Critical Reflection
The paper offers a valuable contribution to the discussion of smart cities, providing insights into both the benefits and challenges of integrating technology into urban environments. However, there are some key oversight one of them being its limited discussion of citizen involvement in the planning and execution of smart city technologies. The paper does not explore how citizens can actively shape the technologies that affect their everyday lives. Furthermore, there is little reflection on the environmental impact of implementing such large-scale technologies, especially regarding energy consumption and electronic waste from sensor networks and smart devices. The paper could benefit or improve more from exploring deeper into the question asked and researching into more depth on other social and environmental matters.

Conclusion
The paper successfully provides an overview of smart city technologies, highlighting the potential benefits of ICT integration in urban settings. It also raises important concerns about security, privacy, inclusiveness, and infrastructure that need to be addressed for smart cities to become fully functional and sustainable. However, the U.S.-centric approach and lack of attention to social and cultural factors present limitations that should be addressed in future work. Overall, the paper serves as a useful starting point for understanding the technological aspects of smart cities but leaves room for deeper exploration of the societal impacts.

Future Research Proposals 
It is suggested for future research it should be more focused on the long-term social and cultural impacts of smart city technologies, particularly in regions outside the U.S. or Developed countries. Comparative studies of smart city implementations in diverse urban settings could provide a broader understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise in different contexts. Additionally, research should explore the role of community engagement and governance in shaping the development of smart cities, as well as more concrete solutions to the privacy and security issues identified in the paper.

Personal Insights
Well personally, this paper is very relevant I would say to today’s era, and it should also be very relevant to Indonesia, as Indonesia themselves are trying to develop a smart city which is Nusantara. So, this paper could bring some insight into developing a smart city. However, as it is written in this paper review, even though there are useful insights to be learned this paper falls short in addressing the social and cultural implications of smart cities. But it’s overall a very insightful and interesting paper.",Kenneth Lay,Kenneth Lay – 2602119272,

Review Paper: Exploring the Latest LLMs
for Leaderboard Extraction
Summary of the Paper:
The paper titled ""Exploring the Latest LLMs for Leaderboard Extraction"" investigates the
effectiveness of various state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) in extracting
leaderboard data from research papers. The study focuses on Mistral 7B, Llama-2, GPT-
4-Turbo, and GPT-4.o, analyzing their ability to extract (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score)
quadruples essential for creating leaderboards that rank AI models. The authors used
three types of contextual inputs—DocTAET, DocREC, and DocFULL—to evaluate the
models' precision in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. The research underscores the
importance of selecting appropriate context to maximize model accuracy, with Mistral
7B outperforming other models in most cases.
Identification of Gaps
Although the paper broadens its scope to various domains of scientific research, a gap
exists in how the models would perform in fields with vastly different structures, such
as humanities or social sciences. Additionally, while optimization techniques like
instruction tuning were used, the paper does not explore in depth the impact of different
fine-tuning strategies on performance across these non-traditional fields. Lastly, the
evaluation metrics focus primarily on accuracy, leaving out considerations for practical
scalability when handling papers with highly inconsistent or ambiguous formatting.
Analysis of Ambiguities
The methodology employed by the paper’s authors, particularly the use of three distinct
context types (DocTAET, DocREC, and DocFULL), provided very useful insight into how
different models handled varied inputs. However, while the methodology is well
detailed for extraction tasks, the paper does not sufficiently explore other alternative
evaluation metrics other than ROUGE, such as extraction-specific F1 scores. The
inclusion of instruction tuning for optimization is a strong aspect of the study, but the
research could have benefitted from experimenting with hybrid models combining LLMs
and rule-based systems for a more comprehensive comparison.
Evaluation of Methodology
The methodology employed by the authors, particularly the use of three distinct context
types (DocTAET, DocREC, and DocFULL), provides useful insight into how different
models handle varied inputs. However, while the methodology is well-detailed for
extraction tasks, the paper does not sufficiently explore alternative evaluation metrics
beyond ROUGE, such as extraction-specific F1 scores.
Discussion of Question Raised
The study raises some critical questions regarding the scalability and domain specificity
of leaderboard extraction. Specifically, how well would these LLMs perform when they
are applied to research papers within non-technical fields with more diverse and less
structured formats? Additionally, the question of how to manage hallucinations in
longer contexts, such as DocFULL, remains partially unanswered. The trade-off
between context length and extraction accuracy is an important issue that warrants
further exploration.
Critical Reflection
The study has shown valuable findings on the capabilities of LLMs in leaderboard
extraction across a broad spectrum of scientific fields. However, while optimization was
achieved through instruction tuning, the paper could have delved deeper into how
different fine-tuning approaches such as domain specific models could enhance the
extraction process further. Another area for some critical reflection is the scalability of
the methodology for tracking real-time research advancements across an ever-
expanding body of work.
Conclusion
The paper successfully and wonderfully demonstrated that LLMs like Mistral 7B, Llama-
2, GPT-4-Turbo, and GPT-4.o can automate leaderboard extraction across various
scientific domains with high accuracy. Mistral 7B emerged as a leader in both few-shot
and zero-shot settings, with the study showing the importance of selecting the
appropriate context (DocTAET, DocREC) to optimize performance. The research
highlights that LLMs, when properly optimized, are able to handle a broad range of
disciplines.
Future Research Proposal
Future research could explore applying LLMs to a broader range of fields, like
humanities or social sciences, to see how well they handle different types of research
papers. Combining LLMs with traditional rule-based methods could also improve
leaderboard extraction, making the process more reliable across various domains.
Additionally, they could use other evaluation metrices to get more in-depth analysis on
their result. Finally, tackling the issue of hallucinations, particularly with longer
documents, would make the models more trustworthy for real-world use.
Personal Insights
I really enjoyed this paper and found the research approach to be quite impressive I
must say. The way the authors used different contexts, like DocTAET and DocREC, to
optimize leaderboard extraction was particularly clever. I also liked how they compared
both open-source and proprietary models, giving a balanced view of their performance.
The attention to detail and design made the results clearer and more practical. Overall,
it’s a very well-executed study that clearly showcases the growing potential of LLMs,
and I appreciate how thoroughly they explored the topic.",Kenneth Lay,F,

Assignment1: LiteratureReview(https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3234873)
Section 1:Summary of thePaper
This is aliterature review for thepaper“AMethod for Fast LeaderboardCalculations inMassive
Online Game-Based Environments”. Online games are amassive partofso manypeople’slives.
There are so many players in different gamesoverdifferent platforms,andinthe worldof today,
theimportanceof a leaderboard inagame cannot beunderstated.
Thepaperaimsto calculateleaderboard calculationsquickly inonline game-basedenvironments.
Here, it triestocreate anefficientand scalableapproach thatimproves olderandmoretraditional
databasemethods,especially inenvironmentswithalot ofusers.
The authors of the paper introduce a solution, that being a Self-Balanced Order-Statistic Tree,
and a hash table to make the calculations to properly fill up the leaderboard. The tree uses
O(log N), which will perform much better than the traditional methods like relational databases
2
or linked lists. Experiments have been done, and it shows some serious speed improvements in
larger-scalescenarios.
Section 2:Identificationof Gaps
The paper focuses on the more technical aspects of the leaderboard calculations, but does not
consider at all integrating more complex game ranking metrics like multidimensional scores.
This works when the rankings are more sequential in nature, but for aspects like social metrics
(unlocked achievements, team collaboration), different game-mode ranks, and skill based
rankings, thesubjectmatter needs tobelooked intofurther.
Validation is also done based on simulations instead of live gaming services, so performance in
actual distributed systems are not fully confirmed. For example, certainload conditionsmay not
be able to sustain the algorithm. This system may, hypothetically, work, but there is no way to
know for sureuntilwetest itonreal-worlddistributedsystems.
Section 3:Analysisof Ambiguities
Honestly, while the technical explanations are pretty good, using simple terms like “fast” and
“cheap” implementations may be a bit lacking when talking about quantitative benchmarks.
Having a more specific metric especially when talking about different gaming environments
shouldhavebeenexplained.
Additionally, asmentioned earlier, thepaperassumes theleaderboardwill beuniversallyhandled
by a single numeric score. While many games do this, there are some that use different
methodologies for ranking theirplayers.
Section 4:Evaluationof Methodologies
The authors did well in using established data structures for in-memory processing. They
implemented a Red-Black Tree for balancing with hash tables for faster access, which is a very
effective approach in my opinion. One big downside however is the fact that they did not
mention the cost of maintaining such structures in a real-time distributed environment.
Considering the fact that video game companies look for a heavy profit, especially with live
service games,thereisno guaranteethat this implementationwill beapreferred option.
Section 5:Discussion of Questions Raised
Two big questions that should be raised is whether this method is really feasible in real-world
environments beyond simulation, and the limitations when multidimensional leaderboard
systems are introduced. These are important as to understand thegeneralizabilityand scalability
of theapproach througheveryonline environment, andnotjust gaming.
Section 6:CriticalReflection
The paper is definitely extremely relevant to modern gaming systems, andgenerally anysystem
that involves a ranking alongside a leaderboard. Focusing on scalability is essential since
expecting the player number to increase in large-scale games is very common. The structure
itself is very clear, and the experimental results are presented really nicely. The onlymain issue
may be the lack of discussion on adaptability of the method to different kinds of data and their
implementationin differentenvironments.
Section 7:Conclusion
Some very significant contributions are studied and handledwell heretothe fieldofleaderboard
calculations. The scalability and efficiency of SBOSTandhash tablesarewell done.Theimpact
it may have is pretty large for single numeric scores, though it may be a much strongerstudy if
real-world validationandmulti-dimensionalapplicationsarelooked intofurther.
Section 8:Future ResearchProposal
Simply broadening the adaptability by integrating complex ranking systems would be a really
great step. Testing the performance under variables like network conditions could also improve
the quality of the research. The biggest upgrade would be applying this method into distributed
systemsand real-worldgames.
An interesting path would be collaborating with fields like education and healthcare, where
games integrating with those sectors are becoming increasingly common. Seeinghow this paper
couldbe appliedelsewhere isawayto broadentheimplementations.
Section 9:Personal Insights
All in all, this method is one good way to create a leaderboard. The scalability aspect is in line
with my project as handling large datasets are important. Still, seeing how to accommodate
complex ranking systems are necessary to make sure that the project works out well in theend,
and provideacomprehensive rankingsystem.",Andrew Tanuwijaya,w,

I’m Andrew Tanuwijaya. I like beef bowls, since they have this interesting combination between
the rice and the beef. The flavors mix really well together, how the sauce just blends them into
one masterpiece. Sushi is also great, for a similar reason, despite being so different. The fish is
raw, yet it compliments the rice so well. Rice, in general, just goes with a lot of meals. That’s
how I would like to describe myself, or at least an ideal of the perfect person I’d like to be. While
I’m a bit more extroverted at the moment, I used to be, and I’m still a very socially anxious
person. If someone makes friends with me and forgets the next few days, I can’t help but
wonder whether I did something wrong or not. I don’t consider myself a nice person, but I try to
help out whenever I can, even if I can’t. This isn’t out of kindness or anything, I just consider it a
shame if someone can’t do their best because of one obstacle I could have helped with.
My key principles lie in those words. Help who you can, whenever you have the ability to do it. I
think it’s a good standard to live by. Even in moral dilemmas, to just do what one can. Lying, for
example, to help someone is something I would consider important. A white lie is better than a
hurtful one. The bitter truth may be a more moral option, but some people cannot handle it, thus
a slightly modified lie to improve their situation may go a long way. This method of living is what
I stand for, and I don’t think I would abandon it unless a desperate situation that calls for a
change in my train of thought arises.
These principles came from myself. Back in middle school, I used to be a selfish, arrogant jerk.
It was that “phase”, and I wish to scrap it from my memory. I was not the best person, and as a
result, I did a lot of things I regret. While external influences exist, the main reasoning came
from my past actions, and how I don’t want a repeat of the results ever again.
My beliefs do stand to my way of living up to today, ever since the tenth grade. Though, I don’t
think I’m in a position to say that, since it’s the people around me that would think I’m following
it, or not. Still, I hope I’ve lived up to half the perfect person I wished to become back when I
apologized and tried to change.

Literature Review ofFile NamingConventions,Habits, and Systems
Introduction
Naming files is something that many people have to do. Students studying innot
only technology fields, but any field that has to do with storing information will likely have its
students managefiles.Forexample,business studentswillhave tomanageorganizationalfiles of
consumer data, product information, etc. Computer science students manage andstorehundreds
of files for their programs.Evenif someoneisnot studying,this is stillvery applicableto awork
environment. Most businesses have a certain workflow where data is stored, and employees
access it constantlyalmost everyday.Thus,naming filesis animportant aspectofdata storage in
general.
Yet, despite that, there are tons upontonsof people whoareeither toolazy, ornotskilled
enough to name their files properly. Students simply downloading files from their school's
learning management system, oremployees downloadingthose filesfor a oneoff andbeingdone
with it. Eitherway, this will cause mismanagement in the long run, due to the large amount of
filesthat will eventuallyaccumulate.
The purpose of this review is to investigate why it is important to properly name one's
files,thedifferent typesof filenaming conventionthatexists, andwhatmorecan bedonefor this
seemingly minor issue that causes long-run problems. Being able to gain a higher depth of
knowledge for this specific topic will allow a better understanding into the reasoning behind
people's minds for their file names, and give an insight on what, possibly, is the most efficient
file naming system. So, the main question in this review is a simple one: ""What file naming
conventions exist, and which exactly would be the most efficient by impacting the productivity
of theuser?""
1
Andrew Tanuwijaya,2602158216
Body
This specific literature review would aim to try and gauge six different literary papers
that cover file naming conventions and file system management, especially focusing on the
section where they all talk about how their users name their files exactly. The choice behind
these papers is to find a diverse group of papers that, although covering different main topics,
relate closelyenough tothemain topic athandfor this literaryreviewspecifically.
1. A Guideto DevelopingaFile NamingConvention [1].
2. A File System for Information Management, or specifically, a file system that explicitly
supports information management[2].
3. The TILDE File Naming Scheme, which is a popular naming method among
programmers [3].
4. File Namingin Humanities andSocial Sciences [4].
5. File NamingAmongPersonalComputer Usersin1999[5].
6. Predicting theContents ofaFile through itsName [6].
As to simplify the paper, it will be divided into three primary themes. This will help
breakupthepaperinto moredigestible sections:
1. TheImportance of HavingaFile NamingConvention [1,2].
2. TheNamingof Files ontheProfession Spectrum[1, 3,4]
3. Innovating File NamingPractices[].
TheImportanceof Having aFileNaming Convention
The first question to answer would be why someone would want to have a file naming
convention. Well, simply put, having this convention would definitely help retrieve those files
much more easily. It will reduce the amount of time you would have to search for it. Once you
are clear, concise, andconsistentwhenit comestonaming files,it willminimize the timeittakes
to search for thesefiles[1].
2
Andrew Tanuwijaya,2602158216
The Nebula file system is a different perspective at filestructuring.Theyuse astructural
approach rather than the traditional navigation method.It is muchlessconventional asit issuper
uncommon by using descriptive names for the files. However, with this system, the files are
found wayfasterand more efficiently[2].
TheNaming of Fileson theProfessionSpectrum
Everyone has different file naming conventions. Usually, those who label their files
would have it named based on their needs and priorities. For example, lots of programmers use
the TILDE method, where the files are organized in a more hierarchical structure known as the
""forest of tree-directorytree"".This more orlessallows theuserto keeptheirpersonal viewof the
directory tree, which reduces any conflicts of names and cross-system portability [3]. Thisway,
fileswill remainorganized nomatter whatsystemthe programmeruses.
On a different side of the spectrum, those studying humanities and social sciences use
descriptive filenames with the date, subject, and project identifiers. This way, files are still
recognizable whentheyare awayfromtheir originaldirectory[4].
This just goes to show how differently people name their files in different fields. There
are lots of differentpriorities whennaming fileslike how portableit is,the descriptivenessofthe
metadata, and so on. Each field’sfile namingareoftendefined bytheirworkflow andthetype of
data theymanage.
Innovation in File NamingPractices
The amazing thing is that techniques to name files and manage systems have been
changing alongside the growing amount of data as scalability, retrieval, and organization
becomes more and more necessary. As mentioned before, the Nebula file system is still one of
the more innovative practices [2]. The more universal and consistent method of naming,
3
Andrew Tanuwijaya,2602158216
however, often includes consistent date formats and version numbers. These are the kinds of
simple factors that usually help maintain file organization and decrease confusion over file
versions.
Research was even done on people who did name their files, and it shows that their
naming conventions areusuallyreflected bytheirpersonalization andorganization needs,though
differing throughout a large span ofindividuals [5]. There wereso manydifferentmethods,from
basic abbreviations to extremely descriptive names. This goes to showhow importantit iswhen
designinga systemthat caterstoboth thesimpleand complexnamepreferences.
A different study also showed that even the most labels people give for their files are
often predictive of their properties and usage. It showedthat propername based informationhas
helped enhancefilesystemperformance [6].
Conclusion
In simple terms to conclude this review, file naming is an important practice that will
influence how efficiently you retrieve and organize your data for the long term. The key to
having excellent organization is that a good structured file naming convention will make sure
that your information stays organized, accessible, and easy to manage later on even when the
amount of dataincreases.
Clarity, consistency and your personal approachis important.TheGuide toDeveloping a
File Naming Convention and the Nebula File System displayed that without a doubt.
Programmers with the TILDE system also showed that even with less conventionalmethods,as
long asyouunderstandwhat youaredoing,anymethod willwork.
After examining all these literary pieces, the most crucial part of file naming is to make
sure you understand why you chose that convention. With the digital world continuously

Andrew Tanuwijaya,2602158216
expanding, having your own naming convention for your data willbecomeeven moreimportant
down thelineto makesureyoustay organizedandkeep yourfiles accessible.

Artificial Intelligenceused tobeasimple, futuristicsci-ficonceptonewouldsee infilms.
The machines that could think for themselves, and take over the world. Back in the 1990s,
everyone used to point and laugh at how ridiculous and seemingly impossible the concept was.
Then, as time went by, technology started to advance, and assumptions were made. Automated
jobslike longdistancetruckers,fastfood drivethrough workers,andother“simplistic” jobswere
going to be replaced, while jobs that required a human soul with creative thinking such as
creative arts, music, and acting were safe. Yet, as we near the end of 2023, major protests were
held for those specific sections due to controversy with the industry replacing these jobs with
artificial intelligence. SAG-AFTRA, the largest actor’s union, held an industry wide strike for
writers and actors alike lasting around for 118 days before a resolution was met. Meanwhile,
online discourse for artificially generated art hasbeen goingonfor morethanjust afew months.
With all this in mind, it becomes essential to figureoutwhy this disputehasoccured. Thisstudy

Methodology
In order to do this research, a survey was handed out through online platformsof theresearcher
such as Instagram, Twitter/X, and Whatsapp. A Google Forms was made, and the data was
collected anonymouslytoensuretruthful results, nomatter howhurtful.
Unfortunately, due to only having one person, conducting a full scale offline research would be
futile, so theresultswere all fromtheonline form.
The first part of the survey asks the user what AI they often use, if any at all. This allows for a
much better understanding of what kinds of AI the respondents arefamiliar with.Then,theuser
is asked what creative industry they frequent in,if anyat all onceagain. Weareable tograspthe
perspective of someone who is working/studying in those industries and can potentially be
impactedbyit.
From there onout,questionsabout whetherAIcould replicatehumans, whetheritcould generate
soulful content,andsimilarly structuredYes/Noquestionswere asked.
Lastly werethree open-endedquestionsto gainabetter insightofthe audience’s opinion,as there
is only so much a researcher can understand if the respondents only answer yes/no and scales
between oneto five.
The first question asked the impact of AI on creative industries from the respondent’s

1. Introduction
“Acomputer woulddeservetobe called‘intelligent’ if itcould deceiveahuman
into believing it was human.”Alan Turing,onewho many considerthe ""Grandfatherof
Artificial Intelligence”,proposedthis statementalongsidea quickexperiment.It was
called the“ImitationGame”, where onepersonengagesinconversationwithtwo
subjects,a humanand amachine.Thisperson,otherwise known asthe ‘judge’,then has
to figure outwhetherthe subjecttheyconversed withwasa humanor machine.If the
judgeisunable todifferentiatethe twoordoes soincorrectly,then themachine would
win.
Whileexperts arguethat this isa testofthe machine’sability tomimichumans
instead of itsintelligence, itis thefirst evertestof artificialintelligenceandoneof the
most famousmethodsof doingso.Theissuewiththis testis that,with recent
advancementsin AI, resultsmay beinaccuratebecause humansarebiasedto bemore
understanding towards otherhumans. Onthe otherendof thespectrum, for thesame
argument, somesay theexam isbiasedtowardsmachines asthey areable tooutperform
humans intasksthat require alotof thinking forward,such aschessandtic tac toe.
So onemay becuriouswhy theTuring Imitation Gameis beingbrought upwhen
thetask athandismore closelyrelated tothecreativearts thanconversation.Well,
accordingto multiplestudies done,includingasurveyfor this specificpaper,a large
majority of peopleareunable totellthe differencebetween AIandhuman-made art.
Figure1: Haveyou personally encounteredsituations whereAI-generatedcontent
hasbeenindistinguishable from human-created content?
1
Outof the32respondents, around 68.8%,whichequates toabout22people, were
unable totellthedifferencebetween contentgenerated byartificialintelligenceand
humans. Thisisan incredibly concerningstatisticto haveas weenteranage of
artificially generatedcontent.Thisstudy aimstofind outwhy this issoand whatcanbe
done aboutit.
Based onthe researchdone,not alotof studiesarebeing doneinthis sectordue
to itsnewnature and howdifficult it isto tacklethesesortsof issues,especiallywithAI
beinghailedasa revolutionary breakthroughwith nothoughtsof concernsabout its
drawbacks. Regardless, onestudy wasfound.A researcharticlewas madefrom
conference proceedingsat theConference ofAI,Ethics, andSociety (AIES). Themain
gap wouldbethelack ofonline discussions beingbrought up,as thatis amajorfactor in
what thisdiscourse wouldbe.
2. Methodology
In order to do this research, a survey was handed out through online platforms
such as Instagram, Twitter/X, and Whatsapp. A Google Forms was made, and the data
was collectedanonymouslytoensure truthfulresults, nomatter how hurtful.
Unfortunately, due to only having one person, conducting a full-scale offline research
wouldbe futile, sothe resultswere all fromthe onlineform.
The first part of the survey asks theuserwhatAI theyoftenuse, ifany atall. Thisallows
for a much better understanding of what kinds of AI the respondents are familiar with.
Then, the user is asked what creative industry they frequent, ifany atall, onceagain. We
are able to grasp the perspective of someone who is working or studying in those
industriesand canpotentially beimpactedbyit.
From there on out, questions about whether AI could replicate humans, whether itcould
generate soulfulcontent,andsimilarly structuredYes/Noquestionswere asked.
2
Lastly, there were three open-ended questions to gain a better insight intothe audience’s
opinion, as there is only so much a researcher can understand if the respondents only
answeryesor noandscale fromonetofive.
The first question asked about the impact of AI on creative industries from the
respondent’sperspective,as that isthe mainpoint ofthe research.
The second question is the respondent’s opinion on regulation changes to control AI
within the creative industries to grasp an idea of what possible solutions the general
populacethinks.
The last question is what a path for artists and AI to somehow collaborate would look
like, or awaythat both partiescan benefit,as that wouldbeabeneficialoutcome.
3. Discussion
3.1TheRiseof AI Technology
Artificial Intelligenceis aconcepteveryoneshould befamiliarwith. Asperthe
layman’sdefinition,AI issimplyarobot that canthink for itself. Whilethatmay be
correct,it doesnotnecessarily paint thefull picture. Well,AlanTuringonce proposed
that tolearn, humansgathered informationandprocessed it.“Why would therebea
reason todoubt robots couldreplicate that?”Unfortunately, computationwascostlyand
ineffective,asthey couldonlydowhat theywere told,not rememberwhatthey did[1].
Eventually, technologyprogressed,andthe verypossibility of AIbecamemore
and morefeasibleas timewentby. However,evenin the2010s,the implicationsof this
dangerwere notevident.AIwas onlytaken seriouslyin thecirclesthat developeditand
studiedit gratuitously.
AI, previously thoughtto besimpleandstraightforward, startedto evolve.While
manythought it was purelydeductive,the contraststarted toshow. It couldrecall
3
previous problems andadapt based onthosesituations, compare currentproblems with
what it haslearned, andmake its ownreasoning withincomplete ormissing information
[2].
3.2: TheSupposed“Golden” AgeofAI
This eracamearound 2015-2020 whenartificialintelligencebegancreeping up
onthegeneralpublic. Notmanystill understoodthegravity ofthe situation,as itwas
becomingusedfor basic,primarytaskssuch asanswering simplequestions,andsilly
applications.
Theseyears were alsothe timewhenvideo-sharingplatformssuch asYouTube
and Vinewerebeginningto explodein popularity.ForYouTube specifically,the typeof
contentgettinga lot ofexposure wasvideogame channels.A singlepersonor agroupof
friends playingvideogames,recording content,anduploading itto theplatform wasa
populartrendback then[3]. These peopleuploading andstreamingvideos were called
streamers andYouTubers,depending onthe platform asYouTube wasbothavideo
hosting anda streamingplatform. Twitch, ontheotherhand, isexclusively astreaming
platform where people sendalive video feedofthem doingsome activitylike exercise,
playing games,or interacting withtheiraudience.Onepopular activity wasthe useof
“EvieBot”,an artificiallyintelligent‘chatbot’, whichmany people usedtotalk toand

Evie Botis consideredartificialintelligence, asshe takestheuser’s inputand

3.3: TheBeginning ofthe End forCreativeArts
Everything changed whentheCOVID pandemicbegansweeping the globe.
Hundreds of millions ofpeople were forcedto stayhome inorderto savethemselves
from thecoronavirus. Meanwhile,those ontheinternet ‘discovered’ ChatGPT,another
artificially intelligentchatbot.This one,however,wasdifferent. ChatGPThadthe
knowledgeof theinternetupto September2019,soit wasessentiallyGoogle thatyou
couldspeak to.It could act asaspecificrolein ordertoteachsomething,troubleshoot
technical problems,or evengive theuserrecipes, according totheirsite[4]. Thisled to
an influx of people usingit asadaily assistantmanager [5]. Eventheconductedsurvey
had atotalof 24people usingGPT.
Figure2: Whatkind ofAIdo you use?
3.3.1: What isAIArt?
BeforeGPTand AIbecamemainstream, artificiallygenerated artwas
alreadyslowlycreeping up.Backin2017,apieceof artsoldfor around $432,500
[6]. It wasgenerated artificiallyandsold nextto piecesmade byAndyWarhol and
RoyLichenstein.Discourse beganbyquestioningif it wasevenart,as itwas
5
generated by inputting manydifferent historicalpiecesof artandessentially
mushing them together.
Modernart,made byartiststoday,is automaticallyprotected bycopyright.
Toquoteinternationalcopyrightlaws, “Asthe copyrightownerof artwork,you
havetheright tomake andsellcopiesof it; makenewworks fromit; anddisplay
it publicly,includingonthe internet. Andif youwantto usesomeoneelse’s
artwork inthese ways,youmust getpermissionfromthe copyrightowner.
Copyright protectionbegins the momentaworkis createdin afixed form;
registration withthe U.S.Copyright Officeisnot required”[7]. Theverysecond
thework ismade, the art isimmediatelycopyrighted, withit belongingto the
artist. Despite that, theseworksarebeing usedwithout consentorattribution.
Figure3: Haveyou noticed any instancesofAI-generated content being used
withoutpropercredit to theoriginal human creators?
Thiskind oftheftis demotivating artists,bothnewandold,from pursuing
this careerduetothe uncertaintyofthe futurein theirline ofwork.There is no
point in becoming anartist if yourworkwill betaken withoutconsentand fed
into a machine,rendering yourjob obsolete.
Thepossiblyworst partofthis situation isresolution, asstolenartcannot
be “returned”. Whenthe artisfed intothe algorithm, themachinelearns fromit
and will notforget.It is, afterall, perfectinmemory,and oncethose worksarein
6
thesystem, thereis nowayfor thedeveloper to“takeitout” withoutresettingthe
machine completely.
3.3.2: An Uncertain Solution
In thesurvey, anopen-endedquestionwas includedwithasimplequery:
“Whatregulationsdoyouthink shouldbeput inplacetomanagethis new
technology?” essentiallyasking for asolution.A newlaw,regulation,or solution
that would enforce andprotectartists.Yet,not asingledefinitive answerwas
provided.Consensual regulation, beingtransparent whenAIisused, orvague
answers weregiven. Thisisbecause thereisnostraight solutionwhentackling
this issue.
Asmentionedbefore, lawswere already putinplacethat protected awork
thesecondit isconceived. Yet,thathas notstopped developers fromstealing
other’swork toinput intotheirsystem. Evenifpeople started obeyingthose rights
all of asudden,the issuewithexistingalgorithmsthat havestolenworks remain.
Thequestionis notevenwhethera governmentbodyor organizationshould force
them todeleteit, butwhetherthey candosoor not.Backupscan bemade, andthe
cyclewouldcontinueendlessly.
Figure4: What regulations do youthink should beput in place tomanage
this newtechnology?
7
In theend,the solutionsprovidedbythe generalpublic dependonthe
morality ofthe developers committingthesedeeds.
3.4: Corporations,Industrialization, and Normalization
Despitethe onlinediscourse, controversy, andprotests, nomajoradvancement
was madeto protect digitalartists.Thewar wentoncontinuouslyfor anotherfew months,
which iswhenanothermajorevent occurred. Thistime,industriesrealizedthe potential
of artificialintelligence andseizedthe opportunitytomake moremoney.
3.4.1: The118-Day Strike
Withnewly developedtechnology,studiosrealizedthey couldsave an
amazing amountof moneybypaying extrabackgroundactorsfor a singledayof
work byscanningthem, saving that data,and keepingthose 3D modelsofactors
for future use.Studios thenreworkedcontractsto havethis clause,saving them
some funds for films.Actors,of course,were nothappywiththis arrangement.
Studios arealreadyinfamous for themistreatmentof actorsandwriters,
from poor workconditionsto unfaircompensation andimpossible goals to
achieve ina miniscule amountof time.Now,withthe proposedchanges,actors
wouldbe paid for asingledayof workfor alifetime ofactingopportunities.The
studio would nolongerhaveto payactors,as theycould just usetheir3D models
forever.As aresult, onJuly14,2023,actors wentonstrikealongside writers,who
had already beenstriking over theusage ofartificialintelligence.
Despitethe longstrike,some CEOswere notrelenting whatsoever.Bob
Iger,theCEOof Disney,said, “There’sa levelofexpectationsthey have,and
that’s notrealistic.”despite livingin aluxury mansion,riding aprivatejet, and
constantlywearing designerclothing.Thefactthat hemakes400times morethan
thelowest-paidworkersignals thesalary differenceinthe entertainment industry
[8].
8
In thisstrike, studioshavealso previously commentedthat theyplanned
on“waitingoutthe strike”, hopingthat theunionmembers wouldlose their
houses andhomes, callingit a“cruelbut necessaryevil”.Thoughthe AMPTP
maybe denyingit, aresolution wasnotfound until afterthe actorsjoined the
strikeaswell [9]. Atlonglast,however,abetter deal wasstruckafter 118daysof
striking.
3.4.2: TheInevitableIndustrialization
Despiteall theattempts tohighlight the dangersof AI,its usagefor
potentially harmful purposeshasnot decreasedatall. AIis stillbeingused for
dangerous activities, harmingalot ofpeople inthe process.
Forexample, oneunfortunatelypopularmeansof useis “deepfake
pornography”, inwhichthe userwouldinputanimageof apersonclothed,and
theAI would returnan imageofthem fully nude.A Twitchstreamer called
“Atrioc”was caught withdeepfakeimages ofhis fellowstreamers,which greatly
disappointed andsaddenedthecommunity.Whilehe istrying tomake upfor it by
combating deep fakes,the factthat apopular streamerdid itremains [10]. If he
did it, thereis anunspeakablenumber of normalpeople who havealso doneit.
Twitch streamersarenot theonlyones guilty ofusing AItosatisfy their
own greed, prioritizingthemselvesover the safetyandwellbeingof otherpeople.
Of course,massivecorporationsoutsidethe entertainment industryhavealso
found ways to‘useit’.
Pizza Hut,for example,is speculatedto haveused AIartfor an
advertisement ontheirsocialmedia.Discourse hasgone around,as itis highly
likelyto be generatedbyartificialintelligence. Allthesigns inthe imagehaving
distorted text, windowsonthebuilding notbeing linear,theinconsistentlength of
linesfor the bikingpath pointtothe factthat this imageislikelyartificially
generated.
9
Figure 5: A post on X/Twitter from theofficial Pizza Hutaccount @pizzahut
[11].
Around the beginning of the year, a YouTube channel called “Corridor”
released a video called “ANIME ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS” in which they
enacted a scenario of overexaggerated movements while playing rock, paper,
scissors. They then rotoscope the video and animate it using AI instead of a
human artist. The main issue with using AI for this is that they simply stole
copyrighted work by training the model using the anime “Vampire Hunter D:
Bloodlust” sothat theirvideo wouldendupinthe styleofthe anime[12].
Although the animation is subjectively terrible and poor in quality, this
does raise concerns over the ethical implications of when the technology is
improved, because at this point in time, it is not a matter of possibility but a
matter of time. The question would be how,if atall, wouldartistsbeprotected. If
someone previously worked as an animator, there would be no one to stop
corporations from training a model on your work whenever this technology is
improved. However, if concerns were not high enough, yet another major issue
dropped around December2023.
10
A trailer for a short feature film was released on the Twitter/X accountof
@zombi_friends that depicted a horror/zombie animated movie. However, the
main cause for concern and controversy was the fact that every aspect of
animation was done with motion capture and AI [13]. The fact that this was all
done by AI is a cause for concern. Just like with Corridor’s video, the general
consensus was that it looked poor in quality, but just like before, this signals a
signof thetimes, asfilms made byAIarebeingreleasedinto cinemas.
The film seems like an insult to animators, as they are incredibly
overworked and underpaid by studios, and to release a film where they were
replaced seems like more salt in the wound [14]. Poor working conditions have
continuously plagued the industry,especiallyinJapan. Largestudioslike MAPPA
have their employees complaining about their situation, especially with the
currently airing anime Jujutsu Kaisen releasing an objectively unfinished episode
[15].
However, American animators are also struggling with projects such as
Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse. It seemed that the writer and producer ofthe
film changed up aspects of the film midway, causing a delay in work [16]. The
animator deadlines, however, wereunchanged, andso theyhadto excessivelyand
tirelessly work to meetsaid deadlines,according tofour anonymous animators.In
additiontothis, qualitycheckswere also done,andeach stagehadtobe approved.
This excessive and poor working condition is why animators are already
struggling in theindustry.Theconstant changein plans,shortdeadlines, andlarge
expectations to create great art is always prevalent in these sectors.However,the
introduction of AI wouldessentiallystripawaywhat littleartistswere making. AI
should have been used by artists in order toincreasethequalityof theirworkand
improve the workflow.If it were usedas atoolto helpartists,wemight havebeen
led to a differentfuture. Unfortunately, thestatusquois havingAI modelsreplace
artists instead. A new type oftechnologyis beingbrought up,a“protectivelayer”
that artists can place over their digital art, which works momentarily but will
ultimatelybecomeuseless oncepeople figureout howto removeit.
11
A question could be brought up, such as“Sowhat ifartistsall quit andAI
replaces them? After all, they are overworked. We might as well, since we areat
this stage.” That very question is the reason for this research and will be a major
talkingpoint lateroninthis paper.
3.4.3Normalization Through SocialMedia
To highlight the further normalization of content theft and algorithm
feeding, TikTok, an incredibly popular short video sharing site, allowed for the
creation of “AI filters”, which were essentially themed under certain “prompts”
for the AI to generate. Wizard filters would use promptslike “magic,cool,mana,
spells, hat”, and more of the sort. The filter would then return an artificially
generated image based on the image the person took and provided. These
generated pieces do not mention what data the model was trained on, much less
theartistswhose workswere taken inorderto createthe model.
TikTok’s own website even suggests using Midjourney or Dall-E, two
sites that are infamous for the non-consensual usage of artists’ worktotrain their
data [17]. The creatorofMidjourney hasopenly admittedin aForbes interviewto
using hundreds of millions of images and data scraped from the internet without
the consent of artists [18]. The normalization of this practice isnot onlyscummy
but alsoconcerning for thefuture ofhuman creativity.
This kind of normalcy is recurring more to the point where even Google
returns AI art despite the user not specifying for it. To testthis theory, thesurvey
had its respondents google“anime art[topic]”,wherethe wordtopic wasreplaced
with a subject of their choosing such as piano, guitar, and so on. For example, a
searchof “animeboyguitar” returned thefollowing results:
12
Figure6: AGoogle Imagesearchfor “anime boyguitar”
It isclear that outofeight results, seven areartificiallygenerated. Thefirst
five images are all distorted in the eyes or hands, which makes it obvious that it
was made by AI. The sixth is real art, while the last two also have distortions. It
becomes clear how concerning the situation is, asasimple Googlesearchalready
gives thismuchartificiallygenerated art.
3.4.4: TheDivision ofPeople
Another reason resolution cannot be found easily is due to thedivisionof
people regarding their opinions on the matter. One side views the situation with
jaded eyes and believes anything to do with technology andartificial intelligence
will become the future. On the other hand, there are people concerned about the
well-being of others and what it could mean for the future if the status quo
continues.
A lotof themajor argumentsoccuronline, asthat is theplatform onwhich
AI art is often distributed as well. Some people label their work as artificially
13
generated, which is the right step, but there are some who want no change tothe
regulationsinregards tothe situation.
One user against artists posted acomicabout someonesaying AIartisnot
human-made, but machine-made. That personwithinthe comicthenproceeded to
take a photo of a ladybug using acamera. Thepoint ofthe comicwastocompare
the generation of AI art and the skillofphotographyand highlight itssimilarities.
However, one person responded, “Being a photographer takes skill. AI art
doesn’t. And also, I don’t know how to tell you this, but the subjects of a
photograph exist materially” [18]. Thepointthey bring upwouldbemorecorrect,
as photography requires the user tomanually adjustlighting, getperfecttiming of
the subject, and more factors that they have to try to control. AI art, on theother
hand, simply requires the user to throw words at amachinetrained onstolendata
to output acombination ofstolendata formattedtothe wordsthe userinputted.
This divide is inevitable, and a resolution for it will notlikely befound in
the near future. Convincing someone of something when they are convinced
otherwise is not a task that is done easily. Unfortunately, this dispute ultimately
factorsinto thenormalization ofartificialintelligencein theartisticindustry.
3.5: A PossibleDegradation
So maybe someone in the world, somewhere, is thinking about one of
these: “Well, what if we just embrace this change? Throw artists in the dirt and
continue down this rabbit hole of artificially generated content.” “Who needs
animators anyway? If they’re so overworked, then just replace them with AI. At
least they won’t have terrible working conditions anymore.” “Why bother
learning art? AI art is much easier, and it’s practically the same thing as doing it
manually, just faster.” If you, as a reader who has read this entire paper,disagree
with all of these sentiments, then that is some relieving news. However, if there
are still any doubts about any one of these statements, this section willhopefully
clearthoseup.
14
Considering the status quo, artists are already afraid of their work being
stolen. Picking up a job that involves art is becoming less incentivizing by the
day, and new artists are less willing to learn out of fear of their skills becoming
obsolete. Working artists arealready barelypaid anything,and withthis direction,
theymaybelosing theirjobs over this.
Displacement in the industry is becoming a more real problemwith each
passing day. However, the hypothetical would be asking what exactly happens to
the creative industry as artists leave the market. Saying all artists simply give up
starting at the beginning of 2024 wouldleavethe internetwith artuntilthe endof
2023.
In this hypothetical situation, thereisnowayfor artas acreativeoutput to
grow because, objectively, the model is only as good as the data it is fed. The
recent most content-generating artificial intelligence models are eerily good
because behind those are art pieces people put their effort, time, and love into.
Once artists ‘give up’ on the industry and all that is left is AI with old images,
there is no way for AIto‘innovate’.It is stillincapableof doingso,as thelimit is
the data provided. Humans, however, have the immense luxury of the limit for
whatever they create, beingtheirimaginations.A popularmethodologyfor testing
algorithms is to go maximum positive and minimum negative, going out of the
scope of possibility for the machines to see their limit. When asked to
continuously depict someone getting angrier and angrier, the AI gives up after a
handfulof tries.Humans, however,cankeep goingonandon.
Eventually, a future where all art, animation, and creative work is
exclusively done by AI would mean newer, fresher, and more creative ideas
would no longer be possible anymore. Even if humans wanted to create
something incredible beyond the imagination of AI, with artists giving up their
skills, no one could conceptualize that exact thought. AI will not be able to
replicate something regardless of the prompt created. That is because art, no
matter what form it takes whether it be traditional, digital, music, acting, or any
other form, is askillcultivated andtrained overtime.Practice andperseverance is
15
what makes humans human. Artistic expression, as humanity knows it, would
eventuallycease toexist.
If AI has the ability to perfectly mimic humans in terms of thoughts, and
conceptualize their own thoughts, we return to the Turing Imitation Game. One
judge, one human subject, and the machine subject. The judge speaks to both
subjects one at a time, without being told which is which. If the judge can
accurately decide which subject is the computer, then the human wins. If not,the
computer wins. The method was scrutinized due to its nature of testing for
copying human thoughts instead of its actual intelligence. However, if AI gains
this capability to truly think for itself, then the judge will receive a 50/50 game
instead of a guessing game as AI perfects itself. At this point, the AI had won a
long, longtime ago.
4. Conclusions and Recommendations
So, the problems and their probable solutions are finally made clear. Artists are
being underappreciated in the current industry, and with the introduction of artificially
generated content, this mistreatment is here to stay. AI is not coming because it has
already arrived and planted itself firmly a long, long time ago. Regulations on it are
sketchyand dodgybecause regulatingit isdifficult.
With AI becoming even more prevalent and exposed to the middle-aged
population, there is no stopping it, as the storm is here. The best conclusionwasalready
touched up upon: artists using AI to help enhance their work instead of replacing them
completely.
This research is not perfect, as a better method would be to have a largersample
size.
However, there is no definite way to turn back the clock. Pandora’s Jar has
already been opened. The current AI systems are trained on unethically obtained stolen
data, and there is no possible chance of undoing it without resetting the systems, which
most, if not all, developerswill refuse todo.Theprotectivelayeris aneffectiveexample,
16
albeit temporary. In the end, the weight of these industries depends on the advancement
of technology,whodevelopsit, andourability toreactcorrectly tothesechanges.

Chapter 1: Insights into the Project
1.1.TheBackground of this Issue
Sincethedawnof time, ashumans, wehavespread traditionalandspiritualvalues
through manydifferentmediums. Backthen,preaching wasandstill isoneof themost popular
forms of spreadingreligiousvalues.Then,television becamethe most popularmethodof
entertainment. Thus,for religions tospreadtheirvaluesmoreeffectively, moviesweremade so
anyonecouldwatchand learnabout acertain religionalong withtheirvalues.ThePassion of
Christ (2004), for example,is stillregarded asoneof thebest religions films,as itdepicts the
sacrificesChrist maderealistically for everyonetosee [1].
Now,oneof themostpopularmediums ofentertainment that themajority, ifnot allthe
youth interactwithoften,isvideo games.Approximately40% ofthe worldplays video games,
and 38% of thatageranges from 18-34 [2]. Gamessuch asMinecraft, Fortnite,andCall ofDuty
became worldwidesensations asmany played them.This mediumhassuch anever-growing
following, so it wouldonlyberight for it tohave spiritualvaluesspreadthrough itthrough
interesting stories.
However,difficulties havearisen, andvideo gameshavebecomeamediumthat gets
moreand moredifficult to useeffectively.
1.2.TheNumbersBehindit
Indonesiaisnoexceptionto this.A simplesurvey, rangingfromhigh schoolstudents to
university students,was held byustosee whatthey thoughtabout videogamesand their
experiences fromthem.
3
Figure.TheResultsoftheSurvey
Thenumbers areclear;at leastonevideo gamehas hadanimpact onthemajority, telling
an interestingnarrative that ledthem togain spiritualvaluesandbetterthemselves.The
importanceof videogamesthat raiseda generationof people shouldnotbe underestimatedas a
mediumto tell storiesandspread valuesthatone maybewouldnot beable toget.
1.3.Facts and SupportingData
Some difficultiesincludethe arduoustasksadevelopermust gothrough inorderto not
only developtheir gamebutalso have itsucceed.Themarket for videogamesis incredibly
oversaturated, andfinding success isvery slim.Nottomentionthe internationalmarket being
extremelycompetitive,making game developmentinIndonesia very off-putting. Onemight
wonderhow thisisa religious/spiritual issue.
Well,a lot of largestudioshave beenpandering tothemasses, creating alarge,perpetual
machine whereconsumers arefed thebareminimumof whatis necessary.Notonly doesthis
hindergoodgameswith meaningfulmessages frombecomingpopular, butitalso createsabad
name for games.
4
RegulationsimplementedbyIndonesia willbetouched uponlater.However,the general
consensus isasfollows:
1. KOMINFO(Ministry ofInformation andTechnology)blocking popularinternational
videogame distributionplatforms.
2. A new,pendingregulation tolimitthe accessof foreignvideo game publishersin
Indonesia.
Chapter 2: The Analysis of Regulations Across the World
2.1.Indonesia’sAttempt toSupport LocalDevelopment
In 2022,a controversy occurred regardingthe decisionof KOMINFO(The Ministryof
Information and Technology)toblock popular internationalvideo game distribution platforms
suchasSteam andEpic Games.Thiswas doneasan attemptto:
1. Incentivize Indonesian playersto purchaseandplay locallydevelopedgamesinstead.
2. Haltthespread of hoaxes throughthesechannels (astheyhave communicativefeatures).
This blockwasdonein tandemwithablock onPayPalandYahoo aswell. Thisdecision
was frowneduponbythegeneralpublic for many reasons.
1. Theability toblocksitesfor those reasons wouldcreatea dangerousstandardthat allows
thegovernmenttolimit accesstoany website,thusincreasingcensorship andlimiting the
spread of information.
2. Concerns regarding thefactthat userdata couldpossiblybe handledpurelybythe
governmentinstead.
3. Banninginternational videogame platformswouldnotallow anyoutsideinfluence, thus
highly limiting inspirationandinnovation.
5
Having outsideinfluenceis alwaysgoodto ensurethat youcanlearnfrom thosewith
different experiencesfrom yourself. Astheyounger generation growsupwithvideo games,
limiting foreign influence mayintroduce astopgap inunderstanding foreignspiritualvalues.
For example,theJapanese believethat thereareGodsandspirits ineverycorner oftheir
surroundings. Rivergods/spirits thatsave farmers duringa drought,or godsthat guidethose who
want successtowardsit. Itis aninterestingforeign culturethat isnot practicedinIndonesia.
This isahighlight of thegame Ghostwire:Tokyo[3], anddespite itnotbeing aprimary
componentof thegame, itis somethingthat playerslearn intuitively.Thisis why videogames
area veryvaluable mediumof entertainment for players,anda methodfor those who wantto
spread spiritual/religious values.People hate itwhenamessage someoneistrying to conveyis
forcedin frontof their faces,and sohavingthe playergothrough anexperienceandfind out
thesemessages for themselves isthe best waytospreadamessage. A bitcorny, sincethismeans
thebest wayvaluesaretaughtis byallowingplayers tofind outfor themselves.Moregameswill
be discussedlateroninthedocument.
Thesecond regulation wouldcallfor foreignpublishers toestablish alocalpresence
beforetheydistributetheirgamesin Indonesia.Companies wouldhaveto registeraslimited
liability companies,or theirplatformswouldbe blocked.This isyet anotherregulation thatadds
unnecessarypressureoncompanies that,if putinto effect, willbebeneficial onlytothe
governmentand notto the developers inthecountry. If anything, itwill havethe oppositeeffect.
This kindof regulation wouldjust addtothe costof operations for thecompanies and
havethefollowing result: Thepublishers donotagree,whichwill mean theirgameswillnot
enter Indonesia.I havedetailedwhy this isan undesirableresult.Notonlythat, butlocal
developers maymissouton collaborationswithinternational publishers. Thisisjust aregulation
beneficial tonoone butthe government.There isnoreason toburden videogame publishers.
Videogamesaside, theblocking ofsocial mediasitesthat donotconformto government
regulationsisa decisionthat maynot bethebest for the population.Oneofthe mostimportant
spiritualvaluesisto realize that youshouldthink for yourself.Having someoneelsedecidewhat
to do for youisneversomethingthat youshouldallow.
6
2.2.What the World isDoing
Thequestioniswhat isthe restof theworld doingtosupporttheirvideo game industries.
Well,for one, South Koreadoes sobyfunding itsgaming industryinstead. Thisway, theesports
scenethrives,which inturn helps theindustry.By providing theirsupport,game developerscan
focusoncreating moregames withgoodmessages withoutburden.
Japan helpsthroughothermeans.Historically,protecting the intellectualrightsof video
gameshasbeenvery difficult. Sincethey havea globalreach, differentintellectuallaws apply
wherevertheygo.Countrieswithweakerintellectual propertyenforcement areextremely
susceptibleto piracy.Anotherreasonis just howcomplexIP (IntellectualProperty) components
are.There aresomanydifferent componentsthat fallunder differentregulations.Game code
fallsunder patents,artwork andmusicbelong tocopyrights,and brandnames/logos need tobe
trademarks.With somany differentcomponentstoprotect, itcan bedifficult, as eachone
requiresa differentlegalprocess.Thus,Japan helps theirdevelopers byhavingarobustlegal
frameworkfor videogameIPs andbyhaving internationalcooperation toensurethat the process
ismuchmoresimplified wheneverneeded.
Lastly,theUKgoesastep further withinternational cooperation. Theysendtheir
developers overseasto internationalconferences andeventstolearn morefromthose whoknow
themost intheir respectiveindustries.Thisis suchan excellentmove sinceitsupports mypoint
that internationalexperiences arethebest wayadomestic developercan learnandgrow.

Chapter 3: The Values They Bring
3.1.TheValue of Video Gamesin Teaching Spiritual Values
Videogameshavealargeinfluence onthe livesofnewer generations.Asalargemajority
playvideogamesoften,the chancesoftheir valuesbeingformed byvideogamesis veryhigh.
Asa lot of theoldgeneration wouldlike totry tostopthis bybanning videogames,it wouldbe
wiserto embracethis change andteachvaluesthrough theseplatforms.Attemptingtoforce
people into learningagainsttheirwill isneverthe answer. Instead,let them findout theanswers
for themselves.This chapter dives intothreegamesthat, although conveying someexcellent
spiritualvalues,donot doso inawaythat forces themessage totheplayer.These gamesare
Persona5,Yakuza 0,andCult ofthe Lamb.Ofcourse,this will includespoilersfor all three
games.
3.2.Persona 5
Persona5isa JapaneseRPGpublishedbyATLUS. It followsthe protagonist,named Ren
Amamiya,who isfalselyaccusedof assaulting apolitician. Inactuality, hewassaving awoman
who wasbeingassaulted bysaid politician. However,withmoney andconnections,the politician
managedto spinthenarrative, makingour protagonist acriminal.Ren isconvicted,and as
penance,isforcedto move citiesto Tokyoandattendanewhighschool.
On thewaytohisfirst day,Ren meetsRyujiSakamoto, anotherstudentof theschool he
was attending,Shujin Academy.Asthey bothmake theirwaytowardstheirschool, the path
somehowleadsthem toa castlewhere Kamoshida,the Olympicmedalist gymteacher, wasa
king. Itturnsout theyhavethe abilitytoenter thecognitiveworld andenterpalaces, a
manifestation of warpeddistortion based onthestrong,corrupt thoughtsof someone.Kamoshida
had beenabusingstudents onthevolleyball teamtoforce results,and althoughthe teachers
knew,theycoveredit upsinceKamoshida’s reputationprecedes him. AsRyujiis almostkilled
and Renisrestrainedashe isforced towatch, hereflectsonhow hehas beenwronged, and
8
resolves hiswill torebel against thedistortionsof society.Thisawakens hispersona,a
manifestation of theuser’spersonality. Ryuji shortlygains oneaswell inanotherpinch.
Whentheymanagetoescape, Renand Ryujitry toinvestigatethe issue,butaremet with
thethreatof expulsionwhen Kamoshidafindsout.AsShiho, anotherstudent,attempts toendher
life toescape Kamoshida, Ann, Shiho’sclosest friend,accidentallyfindsout aboutthe cognitive
world aswell.Thethree, alongwith acompaniontheymet trappedin thecognitiveworld named
Morgana,decideto “steal Kamoshida’sheart” inthe cognitiveworld,which wouldtriggera
change of heartin thereal worldandmake him confesstohis crimes [4].
Asthegame goeson, Ren meetsmorecompanionsandchangesthe heartsof distorted
individualswithin society.Theyforma groupcalledthe PhantomThieves, as theystealthe
heartsof people withdistorted desires andtake advantageofthe weak.There aresomany
spiritualvaluesone canobtain fromthis game.For example,oncethe userawakens totheir
Persona,a physicalmask forms ontheirface,a metaphorfor how theyconform tosocietal norms
byhiding behinda mask.Tosummon thePersona,the usermust ripoff theirmask andreveal
their trueselves.This reflectsa lotabout individualswithin oursociety.We canask thequestion
of who peopletruly are,deep inside,beneaththemask theyput ontoabide bythenorms.
Another majorvalue comeslateron,towardsthe endof thegame, whentheprotagonist
comesacrossa dilemmaas theyattempt tostealthe heartof societyitself. Thecognitiveworld,
named Mementos,isanamalgamationof humanities consciousandsubconscious desires.This
gavebirth to aTreasure, whichis theaspectof humanitythat desiresto becontrolled, thesin of
sloth. Thisaspect forms agod—notan omnipotentone,butone bornfromthesedesires names.
Theeventsof thegame turn outtobea prejudicedtestbythis godtosee if humanity truly wants
nothing but tobe controlled.Ourprotagonist, Ren, isthe ace ofhumanitychosen byIgor,a
representative of theGodof Persona,orthe veryfirst being bornfromthe collective
unconsciousness.This provokesa thoughtwithin theplayerabout whetherit’sbetterfor society
to have onecollectivethought andbecontrolled byYaldabaoth ortofight for change within
society asanindividual with theabilityto makea difference.Thegame teachesus tothinkfor
ourselves andnot conform tosocietal normsif itmeansfitting in.

3.3.Yakuza 0
Yakuza 0isagame set inthe1980s, takingplacein twolocations,TokyoandOsaka, with
twoprotagonists,Kazuma Kiryuand GoroMajima.These twomengothrough differenttrials
and tribulations,each with theirown struggles.
Kazuma Kiryu isalow-level Yakuza,withoutstatus, andjust anothername inthelarge
masses.Ashe ishiredtocollectthe debtof someonewhoowes them,he doeswhathe ismeant
to do andbeatsuptheclient.Thenext morning, itturnsout theclientwas founddead inthat very
alley,andthelieutenantsare nothappywiththis. TheywantKiryu toturn himself in,buthe
knowsthat heisinnocent, asthat mandied fromagunshot wound, despiteKiryunot carryinga
gun.Notonly doesKiryu have atargetonhis back,but hisfather figureand captainofthe
lieutenantsarebeingconsideredfor demotionas hewasthe onewho tookinKiryu.
Tomake matterscomplicated, theclient waskilledinasmall plotof landcalledthe
Empty Lot, apatch of dirt inthe centerof theKamurochoShopping Area. Theareais essentialto
theKamurochoRevitalization Project,whichwouldbring inasubstantialamount of moneyto
whoever completesit. TheEmptyLot is theonly landthat noonecould locatetheowner of,
which isnecessarysincethat personcouldclaimlegalrights overthat ground ifthe projectwas
completedwithout their consent.So, Kiryu isthrown intoathree-way internal warbetween the
Yakuza overcontrol of this land.
Meanwhile, GoroMajimais the“Lord ofthe Night”,the managerof TheGrand,the most
popularcabaret clubinSotenbori, Osaka.Hewasforced intothis roleas penanceduetohis
attemptto betraytheYakuza yearsago.On the nighthemet his quota,his superiorSagawa
raisedtherequired amount to500millionyen.Sagawa thengives himthe optionof continuing
hiswork or assassinatingMakoto Makimura,a ruthlesshuman traffickerwho takesadvantageof
college girls.Although hehas neverkilledanyone,Majima reluctantlytakestheoffer.
His investigationleadsto amassageparlor ownedbyaman nicknamedtheGod Hands.
Heruns into ablind girl working thereandis offereda massage.Heagrees, onlyfor Makimura
to entertheroom afterit’s over.Theyfight, andas Majimawins, otherYakuzaflood theroom
and kidnaptheblind employee.It turnsoutthat shewas MakotoMakimura all along,so Majima
savesher,butthenrealizesSagawa liedabout thehuman trafficking.
10
Heisfaced witha brutal dilemma:whetherto saveMakoto or killher andearnhis place
backin theYakuza.Majimathen finds outaboutthe KamurochoRevitalizationProjectandthe
fact thatMakoto, whoinheritedit fromher grandfather,isthe trueownerof theEmpty Lot. The
storyof Yakuza 0issowellwrittenwith dilemmasand moralsthe protagonistsmustface thatthe
player forgetsthattheyarealso unconsciouslylearning amessage [5].
Both charactersdisplay resilienceandperseverance. Kiryu, beingframed for acrime he
did notcommit andforced intobattleagainst powerfulsuperiors,keeps asteelwill toclearhis
name andprotectthose he caresabout. Majima,held captiveinhis jobandbeing madeto follow
strict, unreasonableorders,held outjust toseek redemption. Despiteitall, herisksit all to
protectthis girl hejust metandensure hersafety asthe entireYakuza comesfor her.
Oneothervalue isself-discovery andfacilitating theirown personalgrowth. Throughout
their respectivejourneys, Kiryufindsthe kindof personhewantsto beashe fightsthrough and
goesthrough trialsto savethose hecares about.Majima goesthrough themost growth whenhe
meets HomareNishitani,a manwho simplydoes notcareabout anythingand liveshislifefreely.
Despiteinitially beingsomeoneforced intopretending tobea calm,collectedmanager,Majima
isinspiredbyNishitani to livelife howhe wantsandis rebornas “TheMadDog of Shimano”.
A notablevaluelearntis keepinghumility andstayinghumble. Kiryuis oneofthe
strongest charactersthroughout theseries, yethe doesnotlook tohisfists tosolve every
situation.Instead,he tries toresolve itthrough peaceful means.Heneverletshispower inflate
hisego andremains oneof themost grounded characters.Majima, ontheotherhand, isforced to
learn humilitythrough his fakepersonalityandjob.However,theselessons impactedhim asa
character,keeping him humbleandhelping otherslater onashe grewas acharacter.
Yakuza 0isfamousfor having anincredibleamount ofside stories for theplayerto do,
and manyhavedistinctlessonsthat teachplayersthe value ofdifferentthings, like valuing their
livesor stayingperceptive eveninmoments ofweakness.It truly isa gamefilled withspiritual
valuesthat donotforcethemselves ontheplayer.
11
3.4.Cult of the Lamb
This gameismore simplisticinits approachtoproviding spiritualvalues.It provides
them ina morestraightforward way.Theprotagonist, alamb, is setto besacrificed byagroup
called theBishopsof theOldFaith. However,justbefore death, youaresavedbyTheOneWho
Waits, agodly beingwhohas beenchained.It savesyoufromthe brinkof death andgives you
thepowerto startacult anddestroythe Bishops,who imprisoned it.
Throughout thegame, yousave peoplefrom thecult ofthe Bishops,andthey joinyour
following instead. Youbring themback toyour base,where it isthe player’sjob totake careof
your followers, ensurethebase issanitized, keep everythingorderly,and makesureyour
followers areloyalto you. Then,youcanassignthem tohelp buildand sustainyourcult.
In theend, however, youcometo realizethatTheOneWho Waitssaved younotoutof
goodwill but insteadto use youasa pawntodestroythe Bishopsandbecomeanalmighty deity
oncemore.Theplayer,whohas beenrelyingonthis entitytobestow powers uponthem,realizes
what itstruenature reallyis.It serves asatestof theconsequences of theplayer’s actions
throughout thegame andtheir moralcompass[6].
Simply put, youlearnthe consequencesof yourown actionsas youdogood and
questionable thingsto helpthe cult grow.Inthe end,theplayer reflectsonwhatthey havedone
and asksthemselveswhetherit istruly worth it.
12
Chapter 4: Possible Solutions
4.1.Solutions
Abandontheproposed changes.Increasingtheoperating costsfor foreignvideo game
publishers hasnobenefitfor localpublishers. Wewouldcompletely reject thislaw for these
reasons:
1. Thepublishers donotpayfor thesecosts,thus pulling theirgamesawayfrom
Indonesia.
2. This meansthat therearefewer internationalgamesonthe Indonesianmarket.
3. Lessinternationalgamesmean lessoutsideinspirationandlessroom tolearn
from others whoknow better.
4. Players wouldwant tofind otherwaystoobtain theseforeigngamesregardless,
usingpossibly lessethicalmeans.
5. Thechancesof Indonesiangamesbeing played moredonotincreasebyasizable
marginin comparisontothe lossesincurred bythis law.
Thecurrent law,asa matterof fact,requiresnochanges.Instead, thegovernment should
just introduceprogramstohelp localgame developers.
1. Start advertisinglocalgamesthat shouldbe spreadmore.If thegameshave good
messages andconvey themproperly, thenthey willbesuccessful. Peoplejust needto
know aboutit.
2. Subsidizegame development.It is anarduoustask, soanylittle bitwill help.
3. Help thegamedevelopersbyflying them outto internationalconventionsso theycan
learn moreaboutgame development,just like theUK does.
13
4.2.Conclusion
Manygameshavepositivemessages, andsincethe younger generationplays video
gamesa lot, theyenduplearningfromit alot too.Inorder tosolve aspiritualcrisis within
society,gameswith uplifting messages toldina goodwaycanreally help.However,games
developmentisstill heavilyundervalued inIndonesia duetothe scarcemarketing of gamesin
general.Thegovernmentcan aidthis byhelping developersgain moreexperienceandexpose
their workfor people toknowabout.
4.3.Reflection
Tobe honest,asa group,welearned alot more.Inorderto portraygamesproperly,we
had tochoose froma lot of excellent ones,andit wasnoeasy task. Playingthose gamesand
learninga bit moreaboutourselves andwhatwecan dofor societywastruly eye-opening.
Having theseexperienceswas aprivilege, andwiththis project, wehopethat otherpeoplecan
also seethevalue thesegames havewhenit comestoconveying spiritualandreligious values.

On July132024,thedoubleeliminationsegment ofthe PacificPlayoffsbegan, andbothPaper
Rex alongsideTalonEsports wereswept up2-0byGen.G andDRXrespectively down tothe
lower brackets.With Korean Valorantassertingits dominanceinthe Pacificregion,both Paper
Rex andTalonEsportsfaced unfortunate defeats asthey mustface offthe nextday for
elimination,whileDRXand Gen.G battlefor thefirst Grand Finalsspot.
In Paper Rex’scase,themaps played wereAscent andIcebox,with theformer being amapthat
theteamwere historically nottoostrongat, havinglost toZETADIVISION andRRQ onAscent
despite stillwinning theseries.Their saving grace,however,is thatthey seemedmuch more
confident,and canattributethe closeloss tolosing bothpistols.
On Icebox,however,it simply seemedasif Gen.G were onadifferentlevel,as theyplayed an
incrediblegame thatPaperRex were simplyunable tokeepupwith. WhetherPaper Rex can
bouncebackand makea lowerbracket runtothe GrandFinals depends if theycan findtheir
stridein theirgame thenext dayagainstTalon.
In Talon’sstory,whilethefirst map wasalso Ascent,the audiencegotto seeDRXbring outtheir
strengths onthenewmap, Abyss.On Ascent, itseemedas if Talonwere unable tostartthe
momentum neededto winrounds, as theywere unable tostringtogether thewinsneeded.
On Abyss,it was afreefor all,a clashofidealsbetween the twoteamsasthey brought out
different compositions.Whilebothteams ranOmen, Cypher,and Sova,DRXwentwithJettand

Andrew Tanuwijaya
Valorant is a tactical five versus five first person shooter developed by Riot Games in which
accurate gunplay goes hand in hand with unique agent abilities. As a video game, it has been
rising in popularity as of late. The free to play model Riot implemented was one of the most
deciding factors, due to content creators establishing the game as a service. Creators further
boosted its popularity during the pandemic when everyone was inside, watching online video
streams [1]. Ever since its beta release in 2020, the game hasbeen experiencingrapidgrowthin
terms of its game balance, audience, and esport. It competes with one of the, if not the most,
popularfirst personshootersof all time,CounterStrike:Global Offensive.
However, Valorant has its own way of standing out. It makes its difference from CounterStrike
by introducing individual agent abilities.Asofwriting, thereare22diverse agentstoplay within
the game, with five being unlocked immediately as you begin. This has allowed for amultitude
of ways for the game to be played,showcasingits community’s creativityandability toinnovate
with what they were given. It is also considered to be one of the most globallyacclaimedtitles,
as even CS:GO had a large skill disparity between Europe and the rest of the world. A study
done inIndonesiashowedhigh satisfactioncorrelating tothe highqualityofthe game [1].
There are many issues with Valorant, of course. No game comes without its problems. At the
highest ranks, streamers stream their game online for many to watch. Some viewers,
unfortunately, decide to watch these streams as they play against them to gain an unfair
advantage through information. Hacking, although very rare, does occur from time to time.The
most pressing issue, however, is related to the best way Riot can expand their game: Valorant
Esports,otherwiseknownas theVCT(ValorantChampions Tour))
Firstly, an introduction to the issue at hand would be appropriate. The VCT circuit isa seriesof
competitive regional tournaments that will allow the winners to qualify for the bi-annual
international tournaments, VCT Masters, and the main annual event, VCT Champions. When
Valorant started out, these regional tournaments were open qualifiers, meaning anyonewithany
team could participate in these qualifiers and earn the right to play internationally. These teams
would then be dubbed international winners, and champions. However, in 2023,Riotdecidedto
change theprofessionalscene model Valorantwouldhave.
At the end of 2022, Riot decidedto switchto afranchisingmodel for VCT.Thismeantthat each
region (Americas, EMEA, and Pacific) would have ten teams selected by Riottorepresent their
respective countries.These thirtyteamswere set instone, andwouldbeguaranteed aspot toplay
each year.This wouldbecome Tier 1,thehighestlevelof Valorant.
Meanwhile, organizations and free agents that wanted to participate in Tier 1 would have to
undergo another tournament, called Ascension. Each region would hold an Ascension
tournament to find the best team, and the winner would “ascend” to Tier 1, where they are
guaranteed a spotfor thenext twoyears.Inorder toparticipatein Ascension,pointsfrom joining
open qualifiers would have to be collected, and teams would have toworkhard tobepartof the
franchised league.
Although this sounds like an excellent, soundproof business model on paper, too many internal
and external factors caused massive issues with this system. Without any solutions to these
issues, then despite being a massive success, one glaringly bleak future could come to fruition:
Valorant’sEsportsscenemay beburning out.
The first issue lies within the Tier 2 system. Unfortunately, there is a problem with funding
within the circuit. In the most basic sense, there is no incentive to invest within this specific
portion of thescene.
In March 2023, open qualifiers for Ascension within the respective regions were held, and they
played until each region had its two representatives, in June. Then, July came, and three
Ascension tournamentsplayed out,onefor the Americas League,onefor the PacificLeague, and
one for the EMEA League. At the end of the month, three teams would ascendfromTier 2into
thefranchised league.
The main issueliesinthe remainingteams, however.Fora greatdeal ofmany teams,Junewould
be the end of their journey for therest ofthe year.Organizations wouldhave topaytheirplayers
salaries if theyheldonto them,andit makesnofinancialsensetokeep payingtheseplayers from
July until March of thefollowing year,sincetheirtimeplaying professionally isover inthat time
period. This hascausedmanyorganizationsto ceaseoperations inValorantTier 2andas aresult,
less money is flowing through this economy. Tier 1 is important to maintain, of course, but it
wouldnot existwithout Tier 2,andif itis neglectedlike this, thenValorant’sesports venturemay
come toa ceasesoon.
As if the situation was not dire enough, commentsmade bytheGlobal Headof ValorantEsports
caused further controversy. Thewinner ofthe Americas2023AscensionLeague wasTheGuard,
a North American organization. They were called a“Cinderella Team”,as inateamthat won by
a miracle, a team that was not expected to perform as well as theydid [2]. However,manytook
that comment badly, as they believed that The Guard performedmuch betterthan someteams in
the franchised league. Even Ludwig, a popular content creator and owner of an organization
competing in Tier 2, made some comments regarding this. Hementionedarelegationsystem to
demote those who did not perform well, and give the slots to more deserving teams that could
perform what was expected at the highest level of the game [3]. Regardless of the good
intentions of the social media post, the nature of how it was said did not resonate well with
everyone.
So some surface level issues of Valorant’s Tier 2 scene should mostly be clear. However, what
about Valorant Tier 1? Surely, the franchised business model,which hashandselected teamsfor
partnerships, would be much less problematic and controversial than Tier 2. Yet, this is not the
case,asproblemsstill arise inthe franchisedleagueregardless.
Valorant is still a relatively new esport, it did not have the time to develop asound structurefor
salaries. This makes some form of sense, considering themassive boomesports hasexperienced
the past few years. Due to the global pandemic of 2020, esports has exploded in popularity,
especially since regular sports could not run. This has led to the aforementioned boom, even
producinga projectionof a $908millionrevenuein 2018[4].
Then, Valorant released in 2020, right in the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone was at
home. To investors, it seemed like a million dollar idea to invest. After all, Counter-Strike had
been an insane success, and this game seemed like the next big thing. So, surelyinvestinglarge
amounts of money would be an excellent idea. While investingin suchascenewas agreatidea,
it isprobablythat toomuch moneywasinvested.
This applies to North American Valorant specifically, asthey aretheones goingthrough arather
rough patch in history at the moment. This problem can be traced backtothe first everValorant
offline internationaltournament, that isMastersReykjavik in2021.
Despite releasing in early 2020,duetothe globalpandemic, Reykjavikwasthe first international
tournament. Sentinels, a North American organization, was going straight for the win with a
flawless record. However, one of their players was under some heavy allegations, and was
unable to participate. So, they brought inTyson“TenZ” Ngo,an ex-professionalplayerwho was
unable to make any waves in the online tournaments, to substitute for him. TenZ was under a
contract with another organization, Cloud9, and so Sentinels had to buy him out. The money
spent waswellover amillion, andthis causedaplayersalary inflation withinthe Valorantscene.
At the time, it was seen as a necessary expense, and Valorant, as a rather new game, had an
uncertain future of costs. So, teams were generous with their expenditure back then. However,
the effects of that are being felt evennow atthe endof the2023season,where salariesaremuch
too high to maintain a reliable business model. Investors are leaving aswell, becauseValorant’s
esports does not seem worth the effort for pouring theirmoney in,asthe chancesof profitlessen
by the day. As we enter the OFF//SEASON, which is a time where there are no “official”
tournaments and players are being exchanged left and right, organizations are clearly trying to
maintain a high quality team while livingoff Riot’s stipends.Thisis anunfortunate consequence
of theearly inflationof salaries inValorant.
Evil Geniuses is another terrible example of what not to do during the OFF//SEASON. Despite
winning VCT Champions 2023, the organization offered an ultimatum totheirplayers. Look for
another team, or stay with them and take a pay cut. Ateamthat proved theywere the bestin the
world were forced to have to cut their salaries [5]. This was a tough decision, but some players
did decidetomoveout.
However, there was another issue, and that was the player buyout. Since those players were
contracted to Evil Geniuses, another organization willing to pick up the player had to pay a
buyout to Evil Geniuses.It hasbeen reportedthat offers ofeven ahundred thousand dollarswere
declined [6]. Thisshowed nothingbut aterriblefuture for Valorant.
This issue is prevalent even in traditional sports. Basketball, for example, is a very popular
offender. There was a time where many considered the “dark age” of contracts, the reserve
clause. Once a playeriscontracted intothe club,they areessentiallytheproperty ofthe club,and
this would be the same for life. The club would have a monopolistic control over this player,as
there wouldbenoincentivetopay ahigher salary.[7]
The main issue requiring a solution quickly would be the treatment of Tier 2, since that would
affect the salaries of Tier 1 through a domino effect. The most effective solution would be
re-evaluating the franchising system, and the development of arelegationsystem,as mentioned.
Limiting ascended teams to two years in the franchisedleaguemay beadecentidea, butalready
franchised teamsthat performpoorly should beheavilyconsidered for relegation.
One franchised team, DetonationFocusMe fromJapan performedextremelypoorly, asthey have
not won a single tournamentwithin theentire year,fromLOCK//IN, aninternational tournament
at the beginning of the year to celebrate the FranchisedLeague, thePacific League,and theLast
Chance Qualifier, the last chance for non-qualified franchised teams to make it intoChampions.
DFM did not manage to win a single game, and so it wasquite concerning.A relegationsystem
shouldatleast beput intoconsideration toensurethe highlevelofcompetition within Tier1.
Secondly, create better incentives and a much more rigid schedule for Tier 2. No organization
would want to pay their team a salary for eight months to do nothing, there is simply no good
reason to do so. Thus, create amuchmoreflexible schedulefor teams tocompeteall yearround,
and let Tier 2 teams into more events in the OFF//SEASON. Make Tier 2 much more
competitive,rather thanit becomingadesert for organizationstodrytheir capital.
Thirdly, more incentives for community involvement in Tier 2 wouldbeanother decentidea.At
the moment, within the game’s menu screen itself, all players can see the franchised teams and
their players. Additionally, anytime an international tournament was being held, there would be
posters advertising it throughout the maps within the game. Players, as they are playing the
game, can see these posters and read them. As we are currently at the end of the Valorant 2023
season, the posters havethenamesof theValorant Champions2023winners.Thisis anexcellent
way to engage players with the esport, even if they initially had no interest. Of course, beingin
the franchised league is what allows for these kinds of in-game exposure. If Riot were to try to
implement somethingto advertiseTier 2matches, itwouldsurelydraw muchmoreattention.
For Tier 1 issues, the quickest solution would be salary caps, just like traditional sports.
However, that will not be necessary. This is because the salaries are already adjusting
automatically during this off period. All organizations are looking to ensure that their spending
on salaries is much more regulated, after realizing how tight revenue will be after the new
system.
One main solution may not come from Riot, and that is player unions. These unions, although
existing, do not have a lot of power within the Valorant economy. Thus, their influence on
organizations,especiallythose that arefranchised,areincredibly limited.
A salary cap may be a solution that couldbeconsidered, butit isvery theoretical, especiallytoa
newgame likeValorant,andlike traditionalsports, thelimitmay eventruncate the organization’s
ability to build a high quality team [8], which would possibly impact their performance in the
league.
Currently, an actual, direct solution may not be necessary. Riot needs not to implement any
serious changes due to the automatic adjustments occurring. However,it wouldbegreatfor Riot
to be more directly involved with how these organizations act. Right now, the economy is
actually correcting itself, letting organizations think more on how to ensure they remain
profitable while still fielding a competitive team for the2024season.However,Riotneeds tobe
more vocal with how these players are being treated in order to create a much better ecosystem
for Valorantesports.
Overall, even as this essay is being written, solutions are being tested. Tier 2 organizations are
merging with one another, or upright leaving, which increases the amount of free agents within
the challenger leagues. Tier 1playersarelooking leftandright for the bestoffer theycan get.An
excellent exampleisZellsis, afranchisedplayer whoused toplay for Cloud9.Hedecidedto join
the organization Sentinels as a substitute, as he believes that the organization would be the best
to build his brand. For players to also flourish within this winter, gaining more social presence
wouldbe thebestway.
Whether the changes and adjustments will work is not something that one can simplycalculate.
It depends on the many external factors that affect the Valorant Esports economy, and personal
decisions players and organizations alike will make from now on.Asobserversofthe scene,we
canonly watchandsee howeverything rollsout.

Valorant Against The World of FPS
Games have always changed across the different centuries of human existence. From the early
existence of throwing dice and sticks [1] to nostalgic retro games, the concept of “games” has
always existed, and will always continue to grow alongside mankind. Technology has evolved,
and with that evolution comes the ability to make even more interactive and immersive games.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was the biggest FPS game for the 2010s. A simple terrorist
versus counter-terrorist game where the objectiveis toplant anddetonatethe bomb,ordefeat the
terrorists and defuse the bomb, depending on the side you were playing on. The tacticalshooter
genreblew up,dueto CS:GO’smassive success.
Riot Games found massive success when they released their multiplayer online battle arena
(MOBA) named League of Legends. In 2019 however, they launched a closed beta test for a
game temporarily titled Project A. The goalbehind thisproject wastocreate amorecasual game
for players with anesports scenethatstill remainspassionate. ProjectA wastheir attempttodive
into the tactical shooter market, and in June 2020, the game was released, under the name
Valorant[2]. However,theuncertaintyof Valorant’ssuccesswasvery prevalent.
This uncertainty was due to the already saturated first person shooter market. Theleadinggame
was the aforementioned Counter Strike, but there were plenty that also hadits fillofthe market.
Another notable example is Overwatch. While there are much more, these two are going to be
the main comparisons when discussing Valorantagainst theWorld of First PersonShooters.This
is due to Counter Strike’s similarity in objectives, andOverwatch’scharacter abilitypool.While
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
each game hasits uniquefeatures, comparisonswillbemade toargue how Valorantstandsout or
fallsshortcomparedto otherFPS games.
Before discussing any main points, clarifications about each game must be made, asthey areall
unique to one another. The main game in Counter Strike, as mentioned before, is terrorists
against counter-terrorists. Terrorists must plant a bomb on a target location and defendituntil it
detonates. Meanwhile, Counter-Terrorists must either eliminate all terrorists before the bomb is
planted, or defuse the bomb once planted. With five players on both teams assigned randomly,
theyfight in abest of 30rounds[3].
Blizzard Entertainment released a first-person shooter game in 2016 under the name
“Overwatch”. It is a multiplayer game, set in a distant future in which robots and humanity are
under siege, necessitating a team to be created to fight back. The name of this organization is
“Overwatch”, and each member had unique abilities or skills players could utilize in game.
Teamswere dividedinto two,withsix playersoneach side.
Within the game, there are four different game modes. Thefirst is“Assault”, oras playerscallit
“2CP”. In this mode, teams alternate between offense and defense, where the offense aims to
capture two points under a time limit. Second is “Escort”, where thereisan offenseanddefense
once again. The offense has to escort a mobile payload through three preset checkpoints. The
payload moves only when uncontested,as whenthereis oppositionnearby,it willnot move,or it
will be stationary, depending on how many playersthereare.Third wouldbe“Hybrid”,whichis
a combination of the two previously mentioned modes. Here, the attackers need to capture a
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
point before the payload can beescorted. Lastis “Control”,where bothteamsfight tocontrol the
central location of a map. The first team to win two out of threesections would gainthe overall
victory. [4] Your team composition would usually have a mix of DPS (Damage per Second),
Tanks, and Support. DPS is a role primarily filled by the players wanting to dish out the most
damage. Tanks are characters that would absorb damage and become a shield for their team
Supports prioritize either healing their team or “buffing” theirteam,a termwhichwouldusually
mean increasingtheirdamage,or other waysofgiving theirteammatesan advantage.
Last, but not least, is Valorant. Riot’s venture into theFPSgenreis ateambased fiveversusfive
bomb defuse type of game, similar to Counter Strike’s iteration. However, there are different
characters, or “agents”, as the game callsit,that the playercanchoose from.Asof writing, there
are 23 agents that the player can use. The game introduces two parallelEarths,the AlphaEarth,
where a resource called “Radianite” has been found, and it is in abundance. The other Earth,
Omega Earth, also has found Radianite, but the resource has been run dry, and they are
struggling to survive. Exposure to this resource has caused some abilities to manifest in people,
which called for the need to form the “Valorant Protocol”. Omega Earth, however, utilizes their
Valorant agents to travel to Alpha Earth and plant the “spike”, which would teleport the
Radianite in the area back to their world. Alpha Earth’s Valorant agents are tasked with
defending the area,and makingsurethat nomoreRadianiteisstolen.Theloregoes muchfurther
and deeper,but thatwouldbethe basicpremise ofthe gameplaystructure.
Valorant also has an agent category system. Four categories of agents exist: Duelists, Sentinels,
Initiators, and Controllers [6]. These agents have different specialties that may bring their team
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
an advantage to win a round. Duelists are the aggressive agents. Their abilities focus on
gathering space for their team, and trying to get kills in order to gain an advantage. This class
may be the one to dictate the pace ofthe roundandcontrol thegame. Themost popularexample
is Jett, a Korean duelist that has the ability to dash towards a certain direction and reduce the
distance between her and the enemy [7]. Next is Sentinels, a category focused on maintaining
space. Their specialty is the ability to hold a part of the map that their team already has control
over. For example, Cypher’s main ability is tripwires that will reveal enemies upon contact [8].
Initiators cangather information onenemylocations orassist aduelistinitiate ontoa site.Sova,a
Russian agent, can shoot an arrow that will reveal all enemies within line of sight [9]. Lastly is
controllers, agents who can smoke areas of the map off to reduce the chokepoints and allow
easier fights. They can reduce the amount of angles their team has to check before attacking.
Brimstone, for example,hasthreesmokesin hisarsenal [10].
The best way to begin is by comparing the mechanics ofthe game, thevery backbone thatholds
up each game. For this section, a comparison to Counter Strike is more relevant due to the fact
that they are similar in styles ofplay. Valorantis ateambased gamein whicheconomy,gunplay,
and team play are incredibly important. Players start on the randomly predetermined side, and
are given thirty seconds (aside from the first round, which gives forty seconds instead) to
purchase a combination of guns and abilities [5]. The economy system is built upwhenaround
is over and a winner is determined, which gives teams a different amount of money based on
objectives completed throughout the round (planting the spike, kills) andofcourse whetherthey
wintheround or not.
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
Once a round starts, players move out,tradingblows withoneanother, andexchangingpiecesof
information through abilities or duels. Players take space through the map, and the attackers hit
the site they think is weaker, plant the spike, and defend it until it explodes. Defenders, during
this time, must try to figure out which site attackers are going to hit, and attempt to stop it or
defuse the spike. Players can also gather “ultimate orbs” for their character to build up to their
ultimate ability. These are obtained through either killing an opponent, dying, or collecting an
ultimate orb which are spread throughout the map. Team compositionscan also bealargefactor
in howa gamemight goduetothe differentagent types.
Now we move on to Counter Strike’s mechanics. In contrast to Valorant’s best of 13, Counter
Strike instead has a best of 16. The main method of how a game goes is similar to Valorant, in
terms of the attacker and defender objectives. Map control and the trading of information is the
integral backbone of winning a round. However, one large contrast between Valorant and
Counter Strike is the latter’s lack of agent abilities. Instead, everyone plays similar characters
that can purchase incendiary, smoke, and flash grenadestoplay themap. Thisstarkdifference in
available utilityisthemajordifference between thetwo.
Thus thematically, in terms of a macro play, Valorant is a much more challenging game due to
the insane amount of different abilities that require you toplanmuch further ahead. Asthereare
five different controllers, that equates to five different ways to “smoke off” the map, or to split
up areas of the map. The same can be said for all the agents within each class, as they all have
many abilities and different ways to play around them. The “meta”, which is short for “most
effective tactics available”, is always changing, especially since agent abilities and maps are
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
always getting changed and reworked. Counter Strike, however, seldom does these kinds of
changes.Some mapswouldrequire youtosmoke acertain areatotake aspecificpartof themap,
maybe you need to gather space in three spots, or you need to take fights towards a lane [11].
The way you play nevertruly changes,whichiswhy it ismuch moredifficult tocontrolthe flow
and paceof thegame inValorant.
The second point regards the character design and abilities within each game. As mentioned
before, Counter Strike does not have any agent variety whatsoever. You load onto the map, and
you have theexactsameutilityoptions as theothernine playerswithin thegame. Overwatchand
Valorant, however, have different roles and abilities, which makes for an interesting case to
cover.
Overwatch’s game is incredibly fast paced. Regardless of the gamemode,the overallpace of the
match would be extremely quick due to the massive amounts of damage characters can do and
how fast objectives can be completed. Overwatch requires fast reactions, thinking, and
adaptations as the ability to change characters in the middle of the game is an option. Players
need to defend the payload, to hold down a part of the map, and once someone is eliminated,
theyrespawnquickly sotheycan returnandrecontestthe areas.
Valorant, on the other hand, is much slower paced, reminiscent of Counter Strike instead. Not
only is it round oriented, but since Valorant’s objective is more towards map control and
outthinking the enemy, players tendtoslowly playthe map,gather information,maintaincontrol
of areas before executing orretaking asite.However,once aplayeris eliminatedduringa round,
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
they do not come back (with the exception of Sage’s “ultimate”, which can revive a character,
though it requires a large amount of ultimate orbs). This forces players to be smarter with their
lives,asa deathwill greatly impacttheoverall firepower ofthat specificround.
Abilities are incredibly important in both games. In Overwatch, the mainreason for itsintensity
and face pace is due to abilities being the character’s central identity. Rapid cooldowns and a
diverse amount of skills are the reason for its insane pace, which forces players to master their
primary weapons (which is presetfor each character)alongsidetheirabilities.Valorant’sabilities
are also an integral part of each character. However, they are designed to complement the
gunplay instead of overshadow it. This slower pace requires players to carefully plan how they
usetheir skillsin contrasttoOverwatch’s constantflashyengagements.
So, Overwatch demands fast decision-making with reactions, while Valorant rewards a much
more strategic and calculated support. Which point is better would lie intheplayer’s preference
in rapid engagements or strategic, methodical depth within Valorant’s gameplay. Both games
need a strong sense of adaptability, despite showcasing a different need for it. This is another
reason whyValorantstands outinits uniquenesswithOverwatch.
The next point to make would be the graphicsof thegames.This isaquick pointto makedue to
its simplistic nature. Counter Strike, Valorant, and Overwatch all have rather different styles.
Counter Strike implements a more “realistic” visual, as realism is one of the main focal points
players pride themselves upon. Both Overwatch and Valorant, on the other hand, use a more
cartoonish style for their worlds. One could wonder then, what exactly would set the styles of
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
Valorant and Overwatch apart. Well, simply put, Valorant goes for a more middle ground
approach for theirvisuals, whileOverwatchexaggerates itspalettes anddesign tocreate aunique
identity. This is not a bad aspect, due tothe factthat Overwatchisa muchfasterpaced andteam
oriented game. Valorant’s approach makes sense as it has unique abilities yet straightforward
gameplay.
The final point is the esportssceneof each game.Themost fair waytocomparethis wouldbeto
look at the most recent events, as Counter Strike: Global Offensive held its last tournament
before it shut down, Valorant Champions 2023 (Valorant’s largest annual event) just concluded,
and theOverwatchWorld Championship alsorecently ended.
Counter Strike’s last tournament is called the BLAST Paris Major 2023. According to
escharts.com, the prize pool is1.25millionUSD. Theeventhad apeakviewership of1.5million
viewers, and had an average of 507 000 viewers. Valorant’s most recent tournament is
Champions Los Angeles. Evil Geniuses were the winners, with Paper Rex beingthe runnerups.
The event peaked at 1.29 million viewers, andanaverage viewershipof 491000viewers,which
is relatively close considering the game is still in its infancy. The Overwatch World Cup,onthe
otherhand, hada peakviewership of318000,and averagedat around129000viewers.
So we can certainly draw some conclusions from these statistics. Esports is a massive market,
and much can be gained from it. A lot of people find it enjoyable, as the suspenseand dramais
one of the core valuesthatmany appreciate.A lotof viewersenjoywatching the players,andthe
aesthetic beauty of it is simply worth watching [12]. Now for the numbers, it is clear Counter
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
Strike istheleaderin termsof FPSesports, withValorantcoming close.Thus,it wouldbelogical
to say “Counter Strike” has the best esports scene. However, this statement is true if we were
only consideringtheoffline events.
Esports is often being streamed online, and popular streamers would “co–stream” the event,
another wordfor streaming theevent andproviding theirown commentaryfor theirviewers. One
popular Valorant streamer is Tarik, an ex-CSGO player who managed to win the Boston major.
Many viewers enjoy watching his takeongames,as heoftenhas moreviewersthanthe Valorant
channel. However, even if you are a small streamer with one or twoviewers, whileyouwill not
be an official partner, you are still allowed to co-stream games. The same can be said for the
Overwatch League, On the other hand, with Counter Strike, as long as you are a large channel,
co-stream permissions are noproblem.However,smallchannels averaginglessthan 500viewers
or so haveanincredibly lowchanceto obtainthe permissions[11]. Thisis becausemost Counter
Strike tournaments are outsourced to different organizers, thus creating complications when
requesting access.
So, while Counter Strike may have higher viewership, the ability to co-stream and grow the
scene’s online presence is much more prevalent with Valorant. This allows much better growth
for the esports scene, and a more sustainable ecosystem for the game. This has helped Valorant
gaina betterbrandidentityas agame, whichalso propelledits success [13].
In conclusion, games have been simply growing at an incredible rate throughout the past years.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was a dominant giant in the first-person shooter genre, which
L3BC AndrewTanuwijaya 2602158216
helped set the stage for Riot Games to enter the market with Valorant. Using unique agentsand
abilities, it managed to stand out and gain a large following over the past three years. CS:GO
focuses on its gunplay, movement, and economy. Valorant prefers abilities to influence gunplay
and map control. Overwatch goes for the ability focused, fast pace engagements. With its
esports, thanks to Valorant allowing co-streaming, theplatform is moreaccessibleandinclusive,
allowing for itsgrowth over time.
Each discussed FPS game has its own unique strength. CS:GO’s golden legacy, Valorant’srapid
growth, and Overwatch’s interesting gameplay cater to the diverse FPS market preferences. As
the gaming market continues to evolve, Valorant does stand out while still making space for
evolutionwithin thecompetitivegaming landscape.

1. (Part 1) SPA and MPA
Single Page Application, or SPA, is a web application that dynamically
rewrites the existing web page with data from the server. It essentially
functions like an application instead of a website where the page is
constantly refreshed.
Multi-Page Application, or MPA, is the common approach for websites that
host a lot of content. Multiple web pages are downloaded when the user
opens the site.
A good aspect of SPA is an excellent progressive web application conversion
[1]. As the page is not reloaded, users can work offline, allowing for a faster
user experience. However, a lot of the advantages differ according to the
developer and their requirements. Development is more difficult in MPA,
though its scalability is limitless compared to SPA, which is severely limited
due to the single page. SPA is also less Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
friendly. Although recent development in technology has improved
performance, there are still issues with indexing SPAs compared to MPAs
[2].
1. (Part 2) SSR and CSR
Server-Side Rendering means that the web pages are rendered on the server,
sending the completed HTML to the browser instead. This improves initial
loading speed and SEO performance, though of course, the load is heavier
on the server.
Client-Side Rendering, on the other hand, uses JavaScript to render the web
page on the browser. Server load is lighter, but the initial loading is longer
and SEO problems may occur [3].
Advantages and disadvantages, once again, depend on the user. For
minimal/static sites, SSR is a much more enticing option. Faster initial load
speeds, and better SEO. Minimalism is preferred due to slow page rendering,
especially with larger elements and higher latency whenever there is an
influx of traffic. It also needs a bigger server to perform well in contrast to
CSR.
CSR is a better option for general websites, especially if expectations of high
traffic and performance exists. Rendering will be slower for the first upload,
but since there is no waiting time for every page to render, the next page will
be fast. Server load is much lower, enhancing the user experience. The
disadvantages are slower initial loading, and it requires more browser
resources. This means that older devices may not be compatible, like
outdated school laptops [4].
2. CDN, otherwise known as Content Delivery Network, is a server network
optimized best to deliver content to users as fast as possible [5]. Speed and
security are two major aspects it specializes in improving by caching content
on geographically distributed servers.
The most common algorithms include:
- Request Routing: The algorithm uses network latency and user
preferences to decide the best CDN server to complete a user request
[6]. Here, DNS-based algorithms are the most common.
- Content Placement: The algorithm here uses content popularity,
network topology, and cost to decide the location and method to
storing content on CDN servers. Static, dynamic, and hybrid
algorithms are used.
- Content Replication: Determining when and how to replicate content
throughout all the CDN server using content freshness and server
load.
3. Load balancing is when client requests are distributed throughout several
servers to help with resource optimization [7], ultimately preventing server
overloading while performance and reliability of applications are
significantly enhanced.
Some commonly implemented algorithms include the following:
- Round Robin: (I found this one the funniest, because I understood it
immediately as it was a very popular video game format) In video
games, the round robin format is when all teams play against one
another, and the teams that wins the most would move forward to a
playoff format, or would win the tournament immediately. The same
logic can be applied here to load balancing, where requests are
allocated to servers sequentially. Each server handles the request in a
rotational manner. While this is the simplest method, in video games,
this means that even the most experienced team may face off against a
very weak team. In load balancing, the load or capacity of the server is
not taken into account.
- Weighted Round Robin: Unlike the Round Robin format, requests are
assigned using predefined weights per server. While it can handle
differing servers, real-time load is still not taken into account.
- Least Response Time: Requests are allocated to servers with the
lowest response time, calculated by adding server connection time and
average response time. While user experience is greatly increased,
monitoring is extremely necessary for this type of algorithm [8].
